# Listenable App

Listenable App is a simple application that demonstrates the usage of the `listenable` library in C++ with GTK+. The `listenable` library provides a convenient way to listen for changes in data and trigger actions based on those changes.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- GTK+ 3
- `listenable` library https://github.com/npsulav/listenable

## Usage

The application displays two labels that are synchronized with `listenable` objects. One label shows a static text, while the other label shows an increasing timer value. The timer value is updated every second.

You can modify the UI layout by editing the `ui.glade` file.
